In other words, World Buffs no longer have any effect in 40-man raid dungeons.											<p>[Note: This change is meant to retain the over-the-top nature of World Buffs and to preserve them as a fun addition to the game, but to remove the toxicity associated with them and to restore the challenge to raid content.]</p>										</div>									</li>									<li>										&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/t1.jpg"></div>										<table>											<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Power Creep Mitigation</span></td></tr>										</table>										<div class="clear"></div>										<div class="ability-text">											To reduce power creep, many items from all 40-man dungeons after Molten Core, especially the weapons and trinkets from these dungeons, have had their item levels reduced and their stats re-balanced accordingly.											<p>Naxxramas gear has been nerfed the hardest, although it remains the highest item level gear in the game.
