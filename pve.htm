This debuff represents the gloom and despair of the deepest, darkest places in Azeroth and nullifies the effects of all buffs that are not applied by players or consumables.  In other words, World Buffs no longer have any effect in 40-man raid dungeons.											<p>[Note: This change is meant to retain the quintessentially-Vanilla, over-the-top nature of World Buffs and to preserve them as a fun addition to the game, but to remove the toxicity associated with them and to restore the Vanilla experience to raid content (World Buffs were not mandated by guilds back in the day).]</p>										</div>									</li>									<li>										&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/t1.jpg"></div>										<table>											<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Power Creep Mitigation</span></td></tr>										</table>										<div class="clear"></div>										<div class="ability-text">											To reduce power creep, many items from Blackwing Lair, Ahn'Qiraj, and Naxxramas, especially weapons and trinkets, have had their item levels reduced and their stats re-balanced accordingly.											<p>Naxxramas gear has been nerfed the hardest, although it remains the highest item level gear in the game.
