If the player earns honour during the week that meets or exceeds his MWP, he is considered to have been active in PvP during that week.  All honour gained from kills, quests, and battlegrounds count towards MWP.											<p>To accommodate players who want to progress in PvP rank at a slower pace (and to prevent short-session honour gain from feeling futile): if the player meets his MWP but does not meet the minimum honour requirement for any progression at the end of the week, then his honour for that week (up to a cap of 100k) will carry over to the next week.</p>											<p>To encourage participation, the player will need to meet his MWP each week or his rank will decay at the end of the week.  The rate of decay is 10% of his current rank.</p>											<p>The player's current rank is displayed on his nameplate.  When inspecting a player, both his current and maximum ranks are listed.  A player can continue to use weapons and equipment earned at a higher rank.
