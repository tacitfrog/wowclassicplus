If the player earns honour during the week that meets or exceeds his MWP, he is considered to have been active in PVP during that week.  All honour gained from kills, quests, and battlegrounds count towards MWP.											<p>We want to accommodate players who want to progress in PVP rank at a slower pace, and to prevent short-session honour gain from feeling pointless.  So, if the player meets his MWP but does not meet the minimum honour requirement for any rank progression at the end of the week, then his honour points (up to a cap of 100k) will carry over to the next week.</p>											<p>To encourage participation, the player will need to meet his MWP each week or his rank will decay at the end of the week.  The rate of decay is a flat 10% of a rank.</p>											<p>For example, a player that is currently at 40% of rank 11 would need to get 1100 honour during the week to be considered active.  If he is active, he will either increase his rank (full or partial) at the end of the week or his honour points (up to 100k) will carry over to next week.  If he is not active, his honour points will be lost and his rank will decay by a flat 10%, leaving him at 30% of rank 11.  MWP can be achieved in a few kills or quests, and this slow rate of decay means that it would take 10 weeks of inactivity to lose a full rank.</p>											<p>Only the player's current rank is relevant; this is displayed on his nameplate.  A player can only buy and use equipment and items if his current rank is high enough.  If a player is down-ranked, any worn equipment that requires a higher rank will be de-equipped and put into the inventory, or mailed if there's no room.</p>										</div>									</li>								</ul>							</div>						</div>						<div class="sidebar-right">							<div class="sidebar-region">								<ul>									<li>										&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/civilian.jpg"></div>										<table>											<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Dishonourable Kills</span></td></tr>										</table>										<div class="clear"></div>										<div class="ability-text">											Dishonourable kills have been removed from the game.
