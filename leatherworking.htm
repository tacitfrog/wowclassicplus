									<div class="ability-text">To give Leatherworkers an exclusive profession bonus, enhancement kits have been added.
									<br class="padder">Enhancement kits are items similar to armour kits that can be created by Leatherworkers, can be mailed, traded, and auctioned, they do not stack, and they can be applied to glove items.  Only a Leatherworker can apply them and doing so will soulbind the gloves to the Leatherworker.  Applying a kit will overwrite any other armour kit or enchantment on the gloves.  The lower level patterns are learned from Leatherworking trainers, the Greater patterns are rare bind-on-equip drops from [unspecified] mobs, and the Superior patterns are bind-on-pickup and sold by the <a href="pve.htm">Karazhan Faction</a> (Revered for Superior Potency and Exalted for Superior Dexterity).
									<br class="padder">Enhancement Kit - Dexterity: increases your skill with all weapons by 1.  Requires level 20 and Leatherworking 150.
									<br class="padder">Enhancement Kit - Greater Dexterity: increases your skill with all weapons by 2.  Requires level 40 and Leatherworking 225.
									<br class="padder">Enhancement Kit - Superior Dexterity: increases your skill with all weapons by 3.  Requires level 60 and Leatherworking 300.
									<br class="padder">Enhancement Kit - Lesser Potency: increases damage and healing done by your magical spells and effects by up to 4.  Requires Leatherworking 75.
									<br class="padder">Enhancement Kit - Potency: increases damage and healing done by your magical spells and effects by up to 8.  Requires level 20 and Leatherworking 150.
									<br class="padder">Enhancement Kit - Greater Potency: increases damage and healing done by your magical spells and effects by up to 14.  Requires level 40 and Leatherworking 225.
									<br class="padder">Enhancement Kit - Superior Potency: increases damage and healing done by your magical spells and effects by up to  20.  Requires level 60 and Leatherworking 300.</div>
