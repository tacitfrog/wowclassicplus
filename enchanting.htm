										When an Enchanter obtains a rare formula, the only characters on the server who cannot benefit from that enchantment is his own alts.  This problem is unique to Enchanting.  To resolve this, but without introducing account-binding or making enchantments auctionable, vellums and Enchanted Mail have been added.  This also enables Enchanters to sell their enchantments by mail, but is deliberately expensive enough that it does not replace face-to-face interactions.

These are non-binding, can be mailed, traded, and auctioned, and they stack up to 10.  Making vellums requires 90/140/190/240/290 skill; Light Vellum is learned from Enchanting trainers, Medium Vellum is learned from an uncommon bind-on-equip formula sold in limited supply from Enchanting vendors, Heavy and Thick Vellums are learned by interacting with formula objects on the ground in Rhapsody Shindigger's camp (Hinterlands) and Thalassian Base Camp (Azshara), respectively, and Rugged Vellum is learned from a bind-on-pickup formula sold by the <a href="karazhan.htm">Violet Eye</a> when Revered.

										<p>Enchanted Vellums are soulbound to the Enchanter and do not stack; these can be used to store an enchantment for later, applied via the trade window, or can be mailed using Enchanted Mail.</p>

										Enchanted Mail is a mailbox service available to Enchanters.  When an Enchanter interacts with a mailbox to send a mail to another character, he may attach an Enchanted Vellum to the mail (as the first and only attachment) and the mail will become an Enchanted Mail.  Only a single item (one Enchanted Vellum) can be attached to an Enchanted Mail; the other attachment slots become blocked out.  If the Enchanted Vellum is detached, the Enchanted Mail becomes a regular mail again.  Enchanted Mail arrives within 1 minute of being sent (the <a href="services.htm">Express Mail</a> checkbox becomes automatically selected).  The fee for sending an Enchanted Mail is 3 gold (rather than the usual 30 copper).  Cash-on-delivery can be used as usual with Enchanted Mail.  Unconsumed Enchanted Mail will be returned to sender after 24 hours (rather than the usual 30 days).
										<p>Enchanted Mail allows Enchanters to send an enchantment to another character, including his alts.  The receiving character cannot take the Enchanted Vellum into his inventory (because the item is soulbound to the Enchanter), but he can directly apply the enchantment to his equipment from the Enchanted Mail.  Applying the enchantment consumes the Enchanted Vellum attachment.</p>
