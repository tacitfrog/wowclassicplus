									<div class="ability-text">To enable Enchanters to enchant the gear of their alts, but without introducing the immersion-breaking concept of account-binding and without making enchantments auctionable, vellums and Enchanted Mail have been added.  This also enables Enchanters to sell their enchantments by mail, but is intentionally expensive enough that it does not replace face-to-face interactions.
									<br class="padder">For example, to send a Crusader enchantment to his alt, an Enchanter would create or buy a Rugged Vellum (made using a Cured Rugged Hide and 3 Illusion Dust), then enchant it with Crusader to create an 'Enchanted Vellum - Crusader (Weapon)' that is soulbound but can be mailed via Enchanted Mail.  When the alt receives the Enchanted Mail, he can apply the stored enchantment to his weapon.</div>

These can be mailed, traded, and auctioned and they stack up to 10.  Making vellums requires 90/140/190/240/290 skill; Light Vellum is learned from Enchanting trainers, Medium Vellum is learned from an uncommon bind-on-equip formula sold in limited supply from Enchanting vendors, Heavy and Thick Vellums are learned from uncommon bind-on-equip formulae that drop from [unspecified] mobs, and Rugged Vellum is learned from a bind-on-pickup formula sold by the <a href="pve.htm">Violet Eye</a> when Revered.</div>

									<div class="ability-text">Enchanted Mail is a mailbox service available to Enchanters.  When an Enchanter interacts with a mailbox to send a mail to another character, he may attach an Enchanted Vellum to the mail (but only as the first attachment) and the mail will become an Enchanted Mail.  Only a single item (one Enchanted Vellum) can be attached to an Enchanted Mail; the other attachment slots become blocked out.  If the Enchanted Vellum is detached, the Enchanted Mail becomes a regular mail again.  The fee for sending an Enchanted Mail is 3 gold (rather than the usual 30 copper).  Cash-on-delivery can be used with Enchanted Mail.  Unopened Enchanted Mail will be returned to sender after 24 hours (rather than the usual 30 days).
									<br class="padder">Enchanted Mail allows Enchanters to send a single enchantment to another character, including his alts.  The receiving character cannot take the Enchanted Vellum into his inventory (because the item is soulbound to the Enchanter), but he can directly apply the enchantment to his equipment from the Enchanted Mail.  Applying the enchantment consumes the Enchanted Vellum attachment.</div>
