Phase 2 Weekend).										<p>During the holiday, all honourable kills made in the open world award an extra 25% bonus honour and the corpses of enemy players can be looted (if you received honour from the kill).  Only one player can loot the corpse, as in battlegrounds.  Looting players yields some silver and a player head.  Player heads are bind-on-pickup, based on the race of the corpse (e.g. Orc Head), unique (you can only carry one head, regardless of race), and start a hand-in quest called Enemy Head.  If you loot a player corpse but already have a player head, the head will remain on the corpse for someone else to loot or until it despawns.</p>										<p>New NPCs called Lunar Ritualists are permanently located in the six major cities.  During the holiday, a Lunar Ritualist also appears in every non-neutral faction camp in all zones that are level 20 or over.  During the holiday, all of these NPCs offer a repeatable quest called The Cleansing and end the (repeatable) Enemy Head quest.</p>									</div>								</li>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/fullmoonfervour.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Full Moon Fervour (Buff)</span></td></tr>									</table>									<div class="clear"></div>									<div class="ability-text">										During the holiday, players get a buff called Full Moon Fervour whenever they kill an honour-awarding player in the open world.
