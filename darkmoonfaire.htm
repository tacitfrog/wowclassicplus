To increase the chance that players will find something special when they visit, new limited-supply opportunities have been spread around the faire.  (Note that other methods have also been introduced to prevent NPC camping: see under <a href="miscellaneous.htm">NPCs</a>.)										<p>Stamp Thunderhorn (food vendor) can now also occasionally sell cooked fish on a limited supply: 1-3 Mightfish Steak, Cooked Glossy Mightfish, Nightfin Soup, Poached Sunscale Salmon, Grilled Squid, Hot Smoked Bass, Baked Salmon, or Lobster Stew.</p>										<p>Sylannia (drink vendor) can now also occasionally sell 1 Volatile Rum or 1-4 <a href="karazhan.htm">Hyjal Nectars</a> on a limited supply.</p>										<p>A new NPC has been added to the zoo area of the faire.  He is a herbalist, trains Apprentice and Journeyman Herbalism, and sells Herb Pouches.  He can also sell all of the same selection of limited-supply herbs as Lhara, on an independent timer.  He also has one additional limited-supply item on his list: 1-3 Runn Tum Tubers.</p>										<p>A new NPC has been added near the bodybuilder area of the faire.  He is labelled as a 'Rock Collector' and sells Mining Picks.  He can also occasionally sell 1-6 Rough, Coarse, Heavy, Solid, or Dense Stones, 1 Shadowgem, Lesser Moonstone, Moss Agate, Jade, Citrine, Aquamarine, Star Ruby, Large Opal, or Blue Sapphire, or 1-3 Silver, Iron, or Mithril Ore on a limited supply.</p>									</div>								</li>							</ul>						</div>					</div>					<div class="sidebar-two">						<div class="sidebar-region">							<ul>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/firework.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Firework Launchers</span></td></tr>									</table>									<div class="clear"></div>									<div class="ability-text">										Some firework and cluster launchers have been added to the Darkmoon Faire that players can interact with.
