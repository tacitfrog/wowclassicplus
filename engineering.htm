										Engineering has always allowed players to craft items from both its specialisations, but in an awkward way (learning one, crafting, unlearning the whole profession, then re-learning).  To avert this, players can now learn both specialisations - however, only one can be active at a time.  The player is now free to complete both specialisation quests.  When he completes the first, he will receive his first membership card.  When he completes the other, the first membership card will be destroyed and replaced.  Membership cards still last for up to 14 days.  When the player interacts with an NPC to renew his card, one of two possible quests will be presented.  If you already have a membership card of that specialisation, it will cost 2 gold to renew it to full duration.  Otherwise (if you have, or last had, the other specialisation active), it will cost 50 gold to switch cards - and your new card will have full duration.  For the purpose of learning schematics, crafting items, and using items, you only count as being a Gnomish Engineer when your Gnomish card is active, and likewise for Goblin.  The book Soothsaying for Dummies no longer offers any service for Engineers.

										Engineers can now gather from the looted corpses of mechanical mobs, such as Harvest Golems.  The list of possible items obtainable from each type of mob includes a number of appropriate engineering materials and junk items, and sometimes multiple items are obtained.  Requires {(mob level - 3) * 5} Engineering skill.
