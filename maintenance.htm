										Many alchemy consumables gave a buff with an effect icon that differed from their item icon.  Examples include Elixir of Ogre Strength, Elixir of Fortitude, and Major Troll's Blood Potion.  These have been fixed so that the effect icon matches the item icon.

										<div class="ability-text">
											The Chronoboon Displacer and its associated mechanics, which enabled everyone in a raid to have every World Buff, at full duration not reduced by travel, which made raids easy, enabled the gear-buying meta, fuelled the bot epidemic, led to the over-abundance of over-powered Tier 3 gear, and therefore trivialised and unbalanced every aspect of PVE and PVP, in short breaking the Classic experience, have been removed from the game.  <span class="hidden">Good f**king riddance!</span>

											The Warlock's unnecessary incubus demon has been removed.  The quest to learn how to summon this demon, which was lazily duplicated from the succubus quest and resulted in the player having two sets of rewards, has also been removed.  The name, text, and icon of the associated talent, and the text in all talents and items that referenced the incubus, have also been fixed.
