						Hello, fellow Classic Andy.
						<br><br>I've always been #NoChanges.  However, the current game is very different to Vanilla WOW and I think that Season of Discovery is essentially a testbed where Blizzard is trialling features for an inevitable Classic+ release.
						<br><br>I think most of the changes in SOD are bad (albeit well-meaning), so I started this Classic+ project to wishlist the features that I think would improve the game.
						<br><br>Goal 1: Fix problems.
						<br>Goal 2: Add stuff that was being discussed back in Vanilla WOW days, but ended up being punted into TBC (and sometimes WOTLK).
						<br>Goal 3: Keep changes to a minimum and in the spirit of Vanilla WOW.
						<br><br>Tanking.  The Rogue tank was discussed right back in the original WOW alpha/beta, and Rogues even had access to shields ("Bucklers").  Some early quests still reward bucklers.  The Rogue tank meta is one of the only good things about SOD.  I envisage a slick avoidance tank, like Bronn from Game of Thrones.  The Shaman tank is another missed opportunity that is mostly abandoned after level 30-35, but would only require a few tweaks to retain viability.  Giving these classes tanking options, at least for 5-man dungeons, would add variety and ease a major bottleneck during levelling.
						<br><br>Raiding.  World Buffs were never a part of PVE meta in Vanilla.  They existed in the game, but few people knew about them - and they were not required by guilds until Naxxramas came out, and even then not all guilds required them, and hardly any guilds did that content.  In fact, all the way up to Patch 1.11 (Naxx), Ironforge was the primary Alliance city due to its location.  The current WB meta in Classic is horrible and the Chronoboon change makes it even worse in my opinion - ensuring that everyone has all of the WBs, for the full duration, which makes the raid content significantly easier, which led to the gear-buying meta, which fuels the bot epidemic.  Most importantly, the current raiding meta is <span class="emphasis">nothing like</span> Vanilla WOW.
						<br><br>Talents.  Each class had a full revamp at least once during Vanilla and talents/abilities were tweaked and balanced regularly.  A lot of obvious problems in the current talent trees were not fixed because they were punted into TBC.  Some were directly fixed in the TBC pre-patch, whereas others were fixed by new abilities throughout TBC.  As such, the problems were addressed in a 'bigger picture', looking forward to level 70 balance, not 60.  Many talents need tweaking and balancing.  Dual-specs were also frequently requested at the time, but not implemented until WOTLK.
						<br><br>This is a work in progress.
						<br><br>JavaScript is required for the navigation menu and talent calculators to work.  Click the buttons above to explore.
