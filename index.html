						Hello fellow Classic Andy.
						<br><br>I've always been #NoChanges.  However, I think that Season of Discovery is essentially a testbed where Blizzard is trialling features for an inevitable Classic+ release.
						<br><br>Given this, I started this Classic+ project to wishlist the features that I think would improve the game.
						<br><br>Goal 1: Fix the problems in the current game.
						<br>Goal 2: Add the better parts of SOD (i.e. the least un-classic parts).
						<br>Goal 3: Keep changes to a minimum and always in the spirit of Vanilla WOW.
						<br><br>With regards to Goal 2, I think that the best parts of SOD are the rogue and shaman tank options.  For the rogue tank, I envisage a slick avoidance tank, like Bronn from Game of Thrones.  I think that this can be implemented with a few tweaked talents that won't spoil existing builds.  The shaman tank is already in Vanilla, it just needs some fixes to make it viable (like having some ability to benefit from Rockbiter Weapon and Windfury Totem simultaneously).  These changes add variety to tanking, which is a well-known bottleneck in the game.
						<br><br>This is a work in progress.
						<br><br>JavaScript is required for the navigation menu and talent calculators to work.  Click the buttons above to explore.
