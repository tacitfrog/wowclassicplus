						Hello, fellow Classic Andy.
						<br><br>I've always been #NoChanges.  However, the current game is very different to Vanilla WOW and I think that Season of Discovery is essentially a testbed where Blizzard is trialling features for an inevitable Classic+ release.
						<br><br>I think most of the changes in SOD are bad (albeit well-meaning), so instead I started this Classic+ project to wishlist the features that I think would improve the game.
						<br><br>Goal 1: Fix problems.
						<br>Goal 2: Add features that were being discussed back in Vanilla WOW days, but ended up being punted into TBC (and sometimes WOTLK).
						<br>Goal 3: Keep changes to a minimum and in the spirit of Vanilla WOW.
						<br><br>Tanking.  The Rogue tank was discussed right back in the original WOW alpha/beta, and Rogues even had access to shields ("Bucklers").  Some early quests still reward bucklers.  The Rogue tank meta is one of the only good things about SOD.  I envisage a slick avoidance tank, like Bronn from Game of Thrones.  The Shaman tank is another missed opportunity that is mostly abandoned after level 30-35, but would only require a few tweaks to retain viability.  Giving tanking options to these classes, at least for 5-man dungeons, would add variety and ease a major bottleneck during levelling.
						<br><br>Talents.  Each class had a full revamp at least once during Vanilla and talents/abilities were tweaked and balanced regularly.  A lot of obvious problems in the current talent trees were not fixed by Patch 1.12 because they were punted into TBC as part of a 'bigger picture' balancing effort for level 70.  Some were directly fixed in the TBC pre-patch, whereas others were fixed by new abilities throughout TBC.  Since we are staying at level 60, many talents need to be tweaked in their current state.  Dual-specs were also frequently requested at the time, but not implemented until WOTLK.  This functionality, if added properly, would add a lot of variety to gameplay and further remediate the healing and tanking bottlenecks at all levels.
						<br><br>Raiding.  World Buffs were never a part of the PVE meta in Vanilla.  They existed in the game, but few people knew about them - and they were not required by guilds until Naxxramas came out, and even then not all guilds required them, and hardly any guilds did that content.  In fact, all the way up to Patch 1.11 (Naxx), Ironforge was the primary Alliance hub due to its location - nobody was waiting around for WBs.  The current WB meta in Classic is horrible due to the addition of Chronoboon - this item enables everyone to have <span class="emphasis">all</span> of the WBs, with no loss of duration when travelling, which makes the raid content significantly easier, which enables the gear-buying meta, which fuels the bot epidemic.  As a result, far too many characters have full Tier 3 gear.  T3 gear is entirely overpowered in Vanilla - it was meant to be extremely rare and was balanced for TBC levelling up to level ~65, not for long-term usage in Vanilla.  The over-abundance of T3 trivialises and unbalances all PVE and PVP content.  Despite #NoChanges, the Chronoboon change single-handedly modified every aspect of the Classic experience.  In summary, the current raiding meta is <span class="emphasis">nothing like</span> Vanilla WOW, has ruined Classic, and needs to be fixed if the game is to endure at level 60.
