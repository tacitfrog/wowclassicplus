						Hello fellow Classic Andy.
						<br><br>I've always been #NoChanges.  However, I think that Season of Discovery is essentially a testbed where Blizzard is trialling features for an inevitable Classic+ release.
						<br><br>Given this, I started this Classic+ project to wishlist the features that I think would improve the game.
						<br><br>Goal 1: Fix the problems in the current game.
						<br>Goal 2: Add the better parts of SOD.
						<br>Goal 3: Keep changes to a minimum and always in the spirit of Vanilla WOW.
						<br><br>With regards to Goal 2, I think the best class modification in SOD is the rogue tank.  I imagine Bronn from Game of Thrones: a cocky avoidance tank.  I think that this could be implemented with a few tweaked talents that won't spoil or overpower existing specs, and it would be a healthy addition to the game.
						<br><br>This is a work in progress.
