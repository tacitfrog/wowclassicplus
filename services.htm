										To inhibit game-breaking gold trading, coinboxes have been added.
										<p>Coins can no longer be sent directly by mail.  Instead, players who want to send money to other characters must create or buy coinboxes and put the money into them to send it by mail. A coinbox can hold up to 100 gold and can be attached to a mail just like other items.  The maximum amount of money that can be sent by a single mail is 1200 gold (12 full coinboxes).  The cash-on-delivery interface has been changed to have 12 item slots that can only accommodate coinboxes, so that the player can attach coinboxes containing gold to pay the cash-on-delivery charge (and therefore the maximum charge is 1200 gold).</p>
										<p>Coins can no longer be traded directly between players.  Instead, players must first put the gold into coinboxes and can then trade the coinboxes in a trade window.  The coin sections at the bottom of the trade window are no longer interactable, but now display the total amount of coin that is currently in the trade window inside coinboxes.</p>
										<p>When the player right-clicks on a coinbox in his inventory, an interface window appears to input the number of gold, silver, and copper coins to be added (by default) or withdrawn (by selecting the appropriate radio box).  When a player hovers over a coinbox, the amount of coins within it is displayed in the tooltip text.  Coinboxes are not consumed when emptied and the player can freely add or withdraw as much and as often as he wants.  Coinboxes can be mailed or traded whether empty or not, can be auctioned when empty, and do not stack.</p>

It can only be used while out of combat and under the effect of Rested (in a friendly/neutral inn or capital city); it has a 10 second cast and a 1 hour cooldown. When used, it switches the character's specs so that the inactive spec becomes active.
										<p>[Note: This item is deliberately similar to a Hearthstone, but for talents.]</p>
