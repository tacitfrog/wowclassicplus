The Tainted Scar in Blasted Lands is now twice the size, extending southward.  Deep in the south, a wall of mountains shrouded in eerie purple smoke separates the southernmost part, where his lair is located.  Players must enter via a small cave to the west of these mountains, within which there is a raid portal.									<br class="padder">The instanced area is a large valley surrounded by mountains and smoke.  There are four mixed packs of Dreadlords, Felguard Elites, and Manahounds around the front edge that must be killed first (or they will agro during the fight).  Lord Kazzak stomps around in the middle and is balanced to a similar difficulty as Onyxia.</div>								</li>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="warlock_files/demonicembrace.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Attunement</span></td></tr>									</table>									<div class="clear"></div>									<div class="ability-text">A questline begins in Nethergarde Keep/Stonard at level 58.  The questgiver fears that a massive demon has entered through the Dark Portal.  The player must obtain an item from Felguard Sentries and then another from Doomguard Minions in Dire Maul: North.  With both items, the player must go to the Shadow Altar in the west of the Blasted Lands to summon and defeat a doomguard mini-boss.  Take this demon's hoof to the questgiver to get a Ground Demon Hoof (green quality trinket).  To enter Lord Kazzak's lair, the player must be wearing this trinket (or an upgraded one) or have it in his inventory.</div>								</li>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/grounddemonhoof.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Ground Demon Hoof</span></td></tr>									</table>									<div class="clear"></div>									<div class="ability-text">Trinket.
