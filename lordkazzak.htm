The Tainted Scar in Blasted Lands is now twice the size, extending southward.  Deep in the south, a wall of mountains shrouded in eerie purple smoke separates the southernmost part, where Kazzak's lair, the Desolate Valley, is located.  Players must enter via a small cave at the northeast of these mountains, within which there is a raid portal.  Players should expect to fight some demons on their approach.										<p>The instanced area is a large, scorched valley surrounded by mountains and smoke.  There are three mixed packs of Dreadlords, Felguard Elites, and Manahounds around the front edge that must be killed first (or they will agro during the fight).  Lord Kazzak stomps around in the middle and is balanced to a similar difficulty as Onyxia.</p>									</div>								</li>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="warlock_files/demonicembrace.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Attunement</span></td></tr>									</table>									<div class="clear"></div>									<div class="ability-text">										A questline begins in Nethergarde Keep/Stonard at level 58.  The questgiver fears that a massive demon has entered through the Dark Portal, with the help of another large demon thought to be hiding in Karazhan Tower.  The player must obtain an item from Felguard Sentries around the Dark Portal and then another from Doomguard Minions in Dire Maul: North.  With both items, the player must go to a summoning circle located somewhere inside Karazhan Crypts (in a hidden room containing lots of demonic gubbins) to summon and defeat a doomguard mini-boss.  Take this demon's hoof to the questgiver to get a Ground Demon Hoof trinket.  To enter Lord Kazzak's lair, the player must be wearing this trinket (or an upgraded one) or have it in his inventory.									</div>								</li>							</ul>						</div>					</div>					<div class="sidebar-two">						<div class="sidebar-region">							<ul>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="warlock_files/demonicembrace.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Loot</span></td></tr>									</table>									<div class="clear"></div>									<div class="ability-text">										Lord Kazzak now always drops one Dark Heart of Lord Kazzak (purple quality, bind-on-pickup item), which begins a quest that allows the player to swap his Ground Demon Hoof for an upgraded version.

The Eye of Shadow can still drop as an additional item, but it's drop rate has been reduced from ~70% to 33%.</p>										<p>Every player can also loot his corpse to get a Demonic Shard; this (white quality) item is bind-on-pickup, non-unique, and does not stack.  Using the item starts a repeatable quest, handed-in to the attunement questgiver; the reward for each one handed-in is 90 silver, 50 Alliance/Horde reputation, and 1 Demonic Rune.
