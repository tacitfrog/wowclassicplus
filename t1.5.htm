The gem starts a quest chain with the Violet Eye's jewelcrafter.  After taking the gem to the jewelcrafter, the player will need to reach Friendly with the faction to progress further.  When Friendly, the jewelcrafter will show an interest in helping the player to craft the ring; he will need some materials and sends the player to find his apprentice.  The player will find the apprentice's corpse in Karazhan Crypts.  Investigating the corpse will trigger an event where cultists ambush the group; looting these cultists will give a note that indicates the presence of a cult hideout deep in the hills surrounding Deadwind Pass.  The jewelcrafter will send the player to cleanse the cult and recover the apprentice's stolen keepsake from its leader.  Finally, in gratitude for returning the keepsake, the jewelcrafter will send the player to gather the materials needed for the ring: some Glowing Sap from Plaguewood (Eastern Plaguelands), a Nightmare Clasp (see under <a href="blacksmithing.htm">Blacksmithing</a>), 3 Mysterious Runes, and the gem.  He will then craft the ring for the player.</p>									</div>								</li>							</ul>						</div>					</div>				</div>			</div>		</div>	</div>		<script type="text/javascript">		var className = "Tier 1.5";	</script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="variables.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="functions.js"></script>	<script type="text/javascript" src="putContent.js"></script></body></html>
