Completing this quest gives the player sufficient reputation to become Friendly with Ravenholdt faction and unlocks three subsequent quests at levels 30, 45, and 55.  These quests will require the player to travel to remote places and either kill the occupant(s) or burgalise it for important documents.  Rogues are still introduced to the faction earlier via the level-24 quest The Manor, Ravenholdt; but they will still need to complete the aforesaid chain to gain access to the new travel quests.										<p>The faction quartermaster sells new types of thrown weapons (level 35 and 55, Honoured), Manual of Spitebomb I and II (<a href="rogue.htm">Rogue</a>, Friendly), Manual of Spitebomb III (Rogue, Honoured), Pattern: Enhancement Kit - Superior Dexterity (<a href="leatherworking.htm">Leatherworking</a>, Revered), and some new trinkets that may be of interest to Rogues and Druids (and Night Elves).</p>									</div>								</li>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/logbook.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Informant's Log</span><br>Binds when picked up.

This item allows the player to collect reconnaissance as an agent of Ravenholdt Manor.  While you have this item in your inventory, when killing humanoids that award experience you have a small chance to loot items that can be handed-in to Myrokos Silentform to increase your reputation with Ravenholdt (similar to Scourgestones).  These items include Illegible Documents (junk), Useful Documents (white quality, 10 reputation), Fencing Operations (white quality, 10 reputation), Sabotage Plans (white quality, 10 reputation), Important Coordinates (green quality, 50 reputation), and, very rarely, Secret Missives (blue quality, 200 reputation), all of which are bind-on-pickup, stack up to 20, and have no sell value.  The junk and white quality items have a drop rate of ~2.5% each, the greens ~0.5%, and the blues drop as often as world-drop blue items.									</div>								</li>							</ul>						</div>					</div>					<div class="sidebar-two">						<div class="sidebar-region">							<ul>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/thrownnature.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name item-uncommon">Poisoned Throwing Knives</span><br>Thrown.
