Completing this quest unlocks four subsequent quests at levels 30, 35, 40, and 60.  These quests will require the player to travel to remote places and either kill the occupant(s) or burglarise the building for important documents.  The first three of these quests are started by Ian Strom in Booty Bay, now revealed to be an agent of Ravenholdt.  The level 60 quest is called Mission: Karazhan and only becomes available when the player is Honoured and has completed the other three quests.										<p>Rogues are still introduced to the faction earlier via their level 24 quest The Manor, Ravenholdt; but they will still need to complete the Shady Missive quest to gain access to these new quests.</p>										<p>There is also a new level 60 quest chain for <a class="rogue" href="rogue.htm">Rogues</a> called Mission: Relic Hunt; this is started by Fahrad when the player is Revered and able to craft Spiteful Poison IV.</p>										<p>Faction reputation can be farmed using an Informant's Log.

This item allows the player to collect reconnaissance as an agent of Ravenholdt Manor.  While you have this item in your inventory, when killing or pickpocketing humanoids that award (or would award) experience you have a small chance to loot items that can be handed-in to increase your reputation with Ravenholdt (similar to Scourgestones for the Ardent Dawn):										<ul>											<li class="nomargin"><span class="item-junk">Illegible Document</span> (junk).</li>											<li class="nomargin"><span class="item-common">Useful Document</span> (10 reputation).</li>											<li class="nomargin"><span class="item-common">Fencing Operation</span> (10 reputation).</li>											<li class="nomargin"><span class="item-common">Important Coordinates</span> (10 reputation).</li>											<li class="nomargin"><span class="item-uncommon">Hand-drawn Map</span> (50 reputation).</li>											<li class="nomargin"><span class="item-rare">Sabotage Plans</span> (200 reputation).</li>											<li class="nomargin"><span class="item-rare">Secret Missive</span> (200 reputation).</li>										</ul>										<p>All of these items are bind-on-pickup, stack up to 250, and have no sell value.

The junk and white quality items have a drop rate of 4% each, the greens 1%, and the blues ~0.1% each.

The quest giver is located in the Violet Eye camp in Deadwind Pass.  Requires the player to find 20 documents scattered throughout <a href="karazhan.htm">Karazhan Tower</a>.  These documents are found in interactable book objects hidden in the dungeon, similar to the Important Blackrock Documents in LBRS.  There are hundreds of possible locations in the dungeon where they could spawn and each raid instance will randomly spawn 4-7 of them (quest completion will take multiple runs).  Everyone in the raid who is on the quest can loot the book objects.  Looting a book object will bind the player to the raid instance (similar to killing a boss).
