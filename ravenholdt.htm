Completing this quest gives the player sufficient reputation to become Friendly with Ravenholdt faction and unlocks four subsequent quests at levels 30, 35, 40, and 60.  These quests will require the player to travel to remote places and either kill the occupant(s) or burglarise it for important documents.  Rogues are still introduced to the faction earlier via the level-24 quest The Manor, Ravenholdt; but they will still need to complete the Shady Missive quest to gain access to these new quests.										<p>Faction reputation can be farmed using an Informant's Log.</p>										<p>The faction quartermaster sells new bind-on-pickup items: types of thrown weapons (level 35 and 55, Honoured), Handbooks of Spitebomb I (<a class="rogue" href="rogue.htm">Rogue</a>, Friendly), II (Rogue, Honoured), and III (Rogue, Revered), Pattern: Enhancement Kit - Superior Dexterity (<a href="leatherworking.htm">Leatherworking</a>, Revered), and three trinkets: Lesser Mark of Ravenholdt, Mark of Ravenholdt, and Seal of Raveholdt.</p>									</div>								</li>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/ravenholdt.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Mission: Karazhan</span></td></tr>									</table>									<div class="clear"></div>									<div class="ability-text">										The level 60 quest only becomes available if the player is Honoured and has completed the other three quests.  It is a raid quest called Mission: Karazhan and requires the player to find 20 documents scattered throughout <a href="karazhan.htm">Karazhan Tower</a>.  These documents are found in interactable book objects hidden in the dungeon, similar to the Important Blackrock Documents in the Warlord's Command quest in LBRS.  There are hundreds of possible locations in the dungeon where they could spawn and each raid instance will randomly spawn 4-7 of them.  Everyone in the raid who is on the quest can loot the book objects.  Looting a book object will bind the player to the raid instance (similar to killing a boss).  Completing the quest rewards the Suspicious Pot Plant trinket.									</div>								</li>							</ul>						</div>					</div>					<div class="sidebar-two">						<div class="sidebar-region">							<ul>								<li>									&nbsp;<div class="ability-icon"><img src="miscellaneous_files/logbook.jpg"></div>									<table>										<tr><td><span class="ability-name">Informant's Log</span><br>Binds when picked up.
